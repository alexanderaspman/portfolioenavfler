          <p>
            I just graduated from Nackademin where I studied front-end development.
            We also had classes in design-tools and database languages On my freetime I work on my own
            development projects such as learning app development, boulder at Kl√§ttercenter and do a lot of
            thriftshopping (mostly interior design). I am now looking for work as a
            developer.
